# ChatGPT Experiments

I experiment with ChatGPT quite a bit, so I though I'd share some of the prompts and the results, so that's this repo.

Each experiment has its own directory and inside will be all the files for the working experiment as well as a *chat.html* file that includes all the prompts and responses.  Save and open the chat.html file to view it.

## Experiments
