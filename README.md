# ChatGPT Experiments

I experiment with ChatGPT quite a bit, so I though I'd share some of the prompts and the results, so that's this repo. One thing I've discovered is that life is much happier if ChatGPT returns something that is 90% of the way there rather than a lot of back and forth. Sometimes that's possible and sometimes it's not, so I've created 2 folders:
- [raw](/raw) - One prompt and one response with no further prompting. Examples in here were produced in "one take".

Either way, each example has its own directory and inside will be all the files for the working example as well as a *prompt.txt* file that includes all the prompts and responses.

Here's the examples:

## Raw
- [Rock, Paper, Scissors game](raw/rps/rps.html) / [chat history](raw/rps/chat.html)

## Multi-Step
