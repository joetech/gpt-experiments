# ChatGPT Experiments

I experiment with ChatGPT quite a bit, so I though I'd share some of the prompts and the results, so that's this repo.

Each experiment has its own directory and inside will be all the files for the working experiment as well as a *chat.html* file that includes all the prompts and responses.  Save and open the chat.html file to view it.

## Experiments
- [Rock, Paper, Scissors game](experiments/rps/) / [chat history](experiments/rps/chat.html)
- [Hangman game](experiments/hangman/) / [chat history](experiments/hangman/chat.html)

## Notes
- I use my chrome extension found [here](https://github.com/joetech/chatbot-save-file) to save the code and chat history
- If you want to contribute examples, please use the [extension](https://github.com/joetech/chatbot-save-file) mentioned above and fork this repo and submit a [PR](pulls) with your example.
- These are experiments, not production code. Don't expect any of the code to be perfect. The goal of each experiemnt is to get a working example with (almost) complete disregard to TDD, coding standards, etc.
